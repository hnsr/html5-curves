cubic hermite spline

//
// - Implement methods for autogenerating tangents for hermite curves:
//
//   - Generate a quadratic Lagrange polynomial for the interior points and their neighboors, get
//     the tangents from its derivative. Start and end tangents need to be given.
// 
//   - Use averaged difference between point and its neihboors, Start and end tangents need to be
//     given.
//
//   - Clamped cubic spline (user specified start/end tangents).

- Maybe use getClientBoundingRect() for better mouse coord handling?

- Think about ditching logging infrastructure for debugging and use console.log instead, might be
  crossbrowser: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Console

- A curve should *always* have at least two nodes, do I need to verify this?

- About automatic tangent generation:
  - Seems most efficient if I just set a flag in Curve when operations are performed that should
    trigger a recalculation of tangents, and only when eval() is called do I actually recalc them.
    - However, since I will typically always redraw immediately after I adjust a control point /
      manipulate nodes, I might as well just update tangents when node manipulation methods are
      called.
      - Then again it does happen a lot that updateTangents is called needlessly, ie. it is called
        once or twice by the constructor and then twice again if load() (which calls setType and
        setNodes which call updateTangents()) is called after that, like it is by CM
        - Although actually updateTangents() is a noop when curve.type defaults to linear, but
          still..


- Allow rotation using CTRL+move
  - calculate midpoint of curve (just use average of all points?)
  - on mouse down, store normalized vector going from midpoint to mouse pos.
  - on mouse move, get normalized vector going from midpoint to cur. mouse pos.
    - get angle between the two vectors? use it to rotate all the points around the midpoint.
    - if I do it in increments like with translation, I wonder if there could be precision problems.. 
      - how can I do it without increments without complicating the code too much?
    - since I have to rotate around an arbitrary point, I would need to translate midpoint to
      origin, then rotate, then translate back.. 


- Think about implementing direct curve selection, might be feasible, essentially can use the same
  idea as drawing loop but instead of *drawing* line segments, check distance to pointer
   - This may be computationally expensive (distance between point and line-segment)
    - an optimized method could be to just eval the curve in short 'steps' and check distance
      between given pos every time, but this can be very inaccurate (or would need a large amount of
      steps), unless I eval using distance (which requires calculating arc lengths etc etc)
  - Then again, it doesn't have to be super-accurate, picking distance could be pretty long
  - Consider this again when I've implemented arclength calculating and/or optimal curve drawing
    (without needing manual tweaking of steps).


- Implement Curve.evalTangent*(), use it in addNode() for positioning newly inserted nodes? Also
  useful later on when adding auto-tangents, I think
